The Jupyter Notebook where all our our model training and testing occured is in BET_Fine_tuning. 

The Notebook can be ran sequentially to recreate our analysis steps.

You will need to install the Transformers and Captum library from Pip which are included in the Notebook.

Our notebook is designed to be run on a GPU or else Fine_Tuning will take too long. Free GPUs for training are available on Google Colaboratory, which we used for the training and analysis process.
